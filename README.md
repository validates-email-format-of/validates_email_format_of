# validates_email_format_of

[![Build Status](https://github.com/validates-email-format-of/validates_email_format_of/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)]( https://github.com/validates-email-format-of/validates_email_format_of/actions/workflows/ci.yml?query=branch%3Amaster)

A ruby gem to validate e-mail addresses against RFC 2822 and RFC 3696.

## Why this email validator?

This gem is actually the O.G. email validation gem for Rails.  It was started back in 2006.

Why use this validator?  Instead of trying to validate email addresses with one giant regular expression, this library parses addresses character by character.  This lets us handle weird cases likes [nested comments](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5322#appendix-A.5).  Gross but technically allowed.

In reality, most email validating scripts will get you where you need to go.  This library just aims to go all the way.

## Installation

Add the gem to your Gemfile with:

```sh
gem 'validates_email_format_of'
```

### Usage in a Rails app

```ruby
# I18n locales are loaded automatically.
class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates_email_format_of :email, :message => 'is not looking good'
  # OR
  validates :email, :email_format => { :message => 'is not looking good' }
end
```

You can use the included `rspec` matcher as well:

```ruby
require "validates_email_format_of/rspec_matcher"
describe Person do
  it { should validate_email_format_of(:email).with_message('is not looking good') }
end
```

### Useage without Rails

```ruby
ValidatesEmailFormatOf::load_i18n_locales # Optional, if you want error messages to be in your language
I18n.locale = :pl # If, for example, you want Polish error messages.
ValidatesEmailFormatOf::validate_email_format("example@mydomain.com") # => nil
ValidatesEmailFormatOf::validate_email_format("invalid_because_there_is_no_at_symbol") # => ["does not appear to be a valid e-mail address"]
```

## Options

| Option | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `:message` | String | A custom error message when the email format is invalid (default is: "does not appear to be a valid e-mail address") |
| `:check_mx` | Boolean | Check domain for a valid MX record (default is false) |
| `:check_mx_timeout` | Integer | Timeout in seconds for checking MX records before a `ResolvTimeout` is raised (default is 3). |
| `:mx_message` | String | A custom error message when the domain does not match a valid MX record (default is: "is not routable").  Ignored unless :check_mx option is true. |
| `:local_length` | Maximum number of characters allowed in the local part (everything before the '@') (default is 64) |
| `:domain_length` | Maximum number of characters allowed in the domain part (everything after the '@') (default is 255) |
| `:generate_message` | Boolean Return the I18n key of the error message instead of the error message itself (default is false) |
| `:with` | Regex | Specify a custom Regex as the valid email format. |

The standard ActiveModel validation options (`:on`, `:if`, `:unless`, `:allow_nil`, `:allow_blank`, etc...) all work as well when using the gem as part of a Rails application.
## Testing

You can see our [current Ruby and Rails test matrix here](.github/workflows/ci.yml).

To execute the unit tests against [all the Rails versions we support run](gemfiles/) <tt>bundle exec appraisal rspec</tt> or run against an individual version with <tt>bundle exec appraisal rails-6.0 rspec</tt>.
## Contributing

If you think we're letting some rules about valid email formats slip through the cracks, don't just update the parser. Instead, add a failing test and demonstrate that the described email address should be treated differently.  A link to an appropriate RFC is the best way to do this. Then change the gem code to make the test pass.

```ruby
describe "i_think_this_is_not_a_v@lid_email_addre.ss" do
  # According to http://..., this email address IS NOT valid.
  it { should have_errors_on_email.because("does not appear to be valid") }
end

describe "i_think_this_is_a_v@lid_email_addre.ss" do
  # According to http://..., this email address IS valid.
  it { should_not have_errors_on_email }
end
```

Yes, our Rspec syntax is that simple!
